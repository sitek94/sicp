## Scheme

### Version

I'm using **STKlos** (version 1.70) Scheme system, which can be found here:

- [STKlos](https://stklos.net/index.html)


### Simply Scheme utils

These are some utility functions that are used in the lectures. It's possible to load them before going interactive: 
```shell
stklos --load /home/sitek/code/sicp/lectures/_simply.scm
```

Because I'm always loading this file, I created an alias for it

```bash
alias stk='stklos --load /home/sitek/code/sicp/lectures/_simply.scm'
```

### Loading files and utils

In the same directory
```scm
(load "utils.scm")
```

Absolute path (Unix)
```scm
(load "/home/user/sicp/utils.scm")
```

TODO: Write util to make it easier to load absolute files as described [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch27/appendix-running.html#text2).
