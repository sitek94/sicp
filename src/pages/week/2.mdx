# CS 61A Week 2: Higher-order procedures

## Reading

- Abelson & Sussman, Section 1.3

  Note that we are skipping 1.2; we’ll get to it later. Because of this, never
  mind for now the stuff about iterative versus recursive processes in 1.3 and
  in the exercises from that section. Don’t panic if you have trouble with the
  half-interval example on pp. 67–68; you can just skip it. Try to read and
  understand everything else.

## Homework

1.  Abelson & Sussman, exercises 1.31(a), 1.32(a), 1.33, 1.40, 1.41, 1.43, 1.46

    (Pay attention to footnote 51; you’ll need to know the ideas in these
    exercises later in the semester.)

2.  Last week you wrote procedures squares, that squared each number in its
    argument sentence, and saw pigl-sent, that pigled each word in its argument
    sentence. Generalize this pattern to create a higher-order procedure called
    every that applies an arbitrary procedure, given as an argument, to each
    word of an argument sentence. This procedure is used as follows:

    ```scheme
    (every square ’(1 2 3 4)) (1 4 9 16) (every first ’(nowhere man)) (n m)
    ```

3.  Our Scheme library provides versions of the every function from the last
    exercise and the keep function shown in lecture. Get familiar with these by
    trying examples such as the following:

    ```scheme
    (every (lambda (letter) (word letter letter)) ’purple)
    (every (lambda (number) (if (even? number) (word number number) number))
    ’(781 5 76 909 24))
    (keep even? ’(781 5 76 909 24))
    (keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter ’aeiou)) ’bookkeeper)
    (keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter ’aeiou)) ’syzygy)
    (keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter ’aeiou)) ’(purple syzygy))
    (keep (lambda (wd) (member? ’e wd)) ’(purple syzygy))
    ```
